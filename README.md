Our project will involve creating a a meal-plan exchange app to allow students to buy and sell unused dining hall benefits. In addition, the app will need features to enable students to meet up in person at specific dining halls in order to share entry. This app will allow students to make money on meals that would have gone to waste, find meals at a very cheap price, and meet wonderful people around campus.
