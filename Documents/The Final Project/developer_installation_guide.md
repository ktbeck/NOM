Note: Users do not need to install anything. Thus, we have written this document an installation guide for developers.

1. The master repository that contains all of the code is on https://github.com/nicolleayon/NOM. Once you have git installed via command line, you can make a pull request. (Git instructions can be googled, and are outside the scope of this guide)

2. Our app uses node. You will need to install npm so you can install of the dependencies we outline in package.json.

3. Our API keys are not published on github. You will need to generate your own API keys, or get access to our official accounts.
