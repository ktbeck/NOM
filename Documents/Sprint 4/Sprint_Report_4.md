### ----- ACTIONS TO STOP DOING -----

We are overestimating the amount of tasks we can do it one sprint and we should stop assuming we can finish tasks on time. We should stop underestimating tasks as we do not have a complete understanding of the tasks. 

### ----- ACTIONS TO START DOING -----

We should have more upfront architecture. We need to discuss more about what we can do and what we can’t do. We should start discussing all our challenges and ask for help when needed. We should more estimating tasks more accurately and distributing tasks to people specifically.
