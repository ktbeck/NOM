### ----- SPRINT 3 REPORT -----
**Product Name:** NOM Dining Hall Meal Exchange  
**Team Name:** Nom Slugs  
**Sprint Completion Date:** November 18, 2018  


### ----- ACTIONS TO STOP DOING -----  
One thing we need to stop doing is underestimating tasks.
As a team, we felt like we had a pretty good understanding of the technologies being used, 
but as we implemented new features we had to learn new aspects to the technologies or learn new technologies altogether for what we wanted to do. 
We did not take this into as much consideration as we should have when estimating tasks.


### ----- ACTIONS TO START DOING -----  
Work on more accurate estimation of tasks in order to realistically be able to implement the features we want to have.
Keep backlog tasks more organized. Prioritize most important features and contribute most of our efforts to those features.


### ----- ACTIONS TO KEEP DOING -----  
Keep showing up on time. We have been doing a much better job than last sprint and being on time will hopefully continue to happen.
Our team has been more communicative than previous sprints.
As a team, we are very productive during our work meetings and find this time to be a catalyst for gettign things done.


### ----- WORK COMPLETED / NOT COMPLETED -----  
We did not get as many user stories accomplished as we would have liked to. There are a few tasks that are very close to being done.
Our team will have to hustle to fully complete the user stories' tasks during sprint 4.

Incomplete: User Story 1: As a seller, I want to list my passes on the site so other students can buy them from me.

Incomplete: User Story 2: As a seller, I want to have an account dashboard so I can keep track of my available guest passes 
and edit my information. We accomplished most of this user story, however we ran into trouble with the profile picture and location. We are putting these tasks into the product backlog for completion in a future sprint.

Incomplete: User Story 3: As a buyer, I want to see information about available passes so I can contact sellers 
and purchase them. One task of this user story involved displaying sellers profile picture and location, 
which were not completed from User Story 2. We put this task into the product backlog for future completion.

Complete: User Story 5: As a seller/buyer, I want a clean, easy to use layout for buying or selling passes.
