----- SPRINT 1 REPORT -----
Product Name: NOM Dining Hall Meal Exchange
Team Name: Nom Slugs
Sprint Completion Date: October 21, 2018


----- ACTIONS TO STOP DOING -----
None - As a team we are completely satisfied with our progress because everyone completed their work on time, without having extra time left over. The meeting times work for everyone, and have provided a sufficient amount of time to get work done as a team. We feel that sprint 1 was completed successfully.


----- ACTIONS TO START DOING -----
Longer meeting times - The first sprint involved mostly individual learning, so the meeting duration did not to be as long. However, as the sprints become more coding intensive, the meeting length will need to be longer to accomodate the additional team work needed. 


----- ACTIONS TO KEEP DOING -----
Same meeting times - The meeting times work well for everyone and there are no other times that would work for everyone in the team. In addition, the various hours allotted for each day have provided more than enough time to get all of the work done.

Team communications - The group chats we have been using as a team worked well to facilitate meeting times and group communication. We anticipate it will continue to be sufficient as the project progresses. In addition, the document sharing via Github and Grepthink have allowed us to be on the same page in terms of learning tutorial and sprint planning.

Technologies - Everyone on the team has adapted well to the new technologies and have learned them at a quick pace. In addition, everyone has successfully been able to access the Github repository.
